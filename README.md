# Architecture

Ecore model, graph nodes, and processors for architecture - architecture elements/building blocks, ...
This model is intended to be a "physical" "reference implementation" of the [TOGAF](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Models/togaf) model. 

The model shall be usable to define architectures and generate documentation. 
It also can be used as a starting point to create organization-specific architecture repositories, wchich contain structures reflecting existing organizaion ways of working. E.g. how people are organized, how information systems are tracked.
