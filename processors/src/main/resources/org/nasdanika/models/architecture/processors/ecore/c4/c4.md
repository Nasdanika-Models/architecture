[Classes](classifiers.html) in this package are mappings of the [architecture model](../../../index.html) classes to the abstractions of the [The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/).

The classes in this package do not introduce any new structural features (attributes or references) or operations, just new semantics.
E.g. [System](references/eClassifiers/System/index.html) and [Container](references/eClassifiers/Container/index.html) extend [CompositeNode](../../eClassifiers/CompositeNode/index.html) -
they can have documentation, icon, incoming and outgoing connections, nested elements, ... 
The difference between them is in definitions.

## Demos

### Internet Banking System

* Generated documentation sites with different [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/4/) themes: 
    * [Cerulean](/demo/internet-banking-system-c4/cerulean/index.html) - can be used to publish the base line architecture - what is already deployed.
    * [Sketchy](/demo/internet-banking-system-c4/sketchy/index.html) - can be used to publish future architectures.
* [Source code](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Models/architecture/tree/main/demos/internet-banking-system-c4)

### Generation

This site was generated with a [JUnit test](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Models/architecture/blob/main/demos/c4/src/test/java/org/nasdanika/models/architecture/demos/c4/tests/TestC4SiteGen.java).
Another way to generate documentation site is to use [Nasdanika CLI](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/index.html) [app/model/site](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/app/model/site/index.html) command
or [app/model/action](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/app/model/action/index.html) command and then [app/site](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/app/site/index.html) command.
