The the above diagram is a [Container diagram](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram), which is "zoom-in to the system boundary".

## Mapping

### Surroundings -> selectors

"Personal Banking Customer", "E-mail System", and "Mainframe Banking System" diagram elements are mapped to the same semantic elements as on the System Context Diagram using ``selector``s. 
The system context diagram defines the surrounding nodes and this diagram references them.

This is a selector of the "E-mail System":

```yaml
getDocument().getModelElementByProperty('semantic-id', 'microsoft-exchange')
```

The loading logic "carries over" tooltips from the System Context Diagram to this diagram.

### Internet Banking System

The "Internet Banking System" container maps to the same semantic element as on the System Context diagram because:

* The "Internet Banking System" element on the System Context Diagram links to this diagram page.
* The "Internet Banking System" element on this diagram has ``page-element`` property set to ``true``.   

Semantic elements of the child elements of the "Internet Banking System" element are mapped to the ``elements`` reference and ordered with the ``flow`` comparator:

```yaml
container:
  self: 
    elements:
      path: 1
      comparator: 
        flow: 
          fallback: label
          condition: id != 'send-email'
```          

The condition prevents traversal of the "API Application" -> "E-mail System" connection. 
It is not really necessary here - the order would not change without it.
It is provided as an example because connection conditions may be necessary in some cases for proper ordering in diagrams with connection cycles.

### Containers

All containers within the system except the "API Application" are mapped to [Node](https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/references/eClassifiers/Node/index.html)s, similar to the surroundings on the System Context diagram.


#### API Application 

The "API Application" diagram element is mapped to [CompositeNode](https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/references/eClassifiers/CompositeNode/index.html) because it has sub-elements.
It is linked to the "Container Diagram" page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the "API Application Component Diagram" page element as well allowing further mapping on [that page](references/elements/api-application/index.html).

This diagram element defines ``base-uri`` property as ``%id%/``.
Because "Placeholders" is checked, ``%id%/`` expands to ``api-application/`` during loading. 
``doc-ref`` is set to ``readme.md``, which in combination with ``base-uri`` resolves to [``api-appliction/readme.md``](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Models/architecture/blob/main/demos/internet-banking-system/api-application/readme.md).
