This site was generated as explained below:

* A [Drawio](https://www.drawio.com/) diagram of an Internet Banking System was created based on images and descriptions from [The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/). Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim. The diagram uses free icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. 
* The diagram was [mapped](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Models/family#mapping) the [Architecture model](https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/) using properties of the diagram elements.
* Then the architecture model was transformed to the [HTML Application model](https://html-app.models.nasdanika.org/index.html) and a static web site was generated from that model.

Some highlights:

* Diagram elements have tooltips with descriptions from the C4 model site.
* A click on a diagram element navigates to the element page.
* The left navigation provides full-text search which also searches for text in diagrams.
* [Search](search.html) is a more featureful interface to the same search. 
* [Glossary](glossary.html) provides a list of "terms" - a dictionary of the language of the system. It needs improvements - currently it shows all actions. Uncheck "Hide UUID" to see the elements. Elements can be filtered using the filter text field.
* There is a link to the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Models/architecture/tree/main/demos/internet-banking-system) in the footer.

The the above diagram is a [System Context diagram](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram), which is

> a good starting point for diagramming and 
> documenting a software system, allowing you to step back 
> and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box
>  in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it
> interacts with.
