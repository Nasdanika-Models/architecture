This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends (or vice versa). Unfortunately the term &ldquo;software system&rdquo; is the hardest of the C4 model abstractions to define, and this isn&rsquo;t helped by the fact that each organisation will also have their own terminology for describing the same thing, typically using terms such as &ldquo;application&rdquo;, &ldquo;product&rdquo;, &ldquo;service&rdquo;, etc. One way to think about it is that a software system is something a single software development team is building, owns, has responsibility for, and can see the internal implementation details of. Perhaps the code for that software system resides in a single source code repository, and anybody on the team is entitled to modify it. In many cases, the boundary of a software system will correspond to the boundary of a single team. It may also be the case that everything inside the boundary of a software system is deployed at the same time.1 Copied verbatim from The C4 model for visualizing software architecture under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ↩"},"demo/internet-banking-system/search.html":{"action-uuid":"1233c028-da38-4172-bdcb-d635cfc77146","title":"Search","content":"Clear"},"references/eClassifiers/Undergoer/inheritance.html":{"path":"Undergoer/Inheritance","action-uuid":"12c2a107-b402-4241-b3a9-7c7908a6a4f8","title":"Inheritance","content":"Subtypes "},"demo/internet-banking-system-c4/cerulean/glossary.html":{"action-uuid":"1bdd5d02-17e7-46ed-93d4-1b3bc4354476","title":"Glossary","content":"Clear Identifier(s) Hide UUID {{data.value.name}} {{data.value[0].value}} {{item.value}}"},"references/eClassifiers/Role/references/eStructuralFeatures/extends/index.html":{"path":"Role/References/extends","action-uuid":"3a7e326f-34a9-493b-ba88-ef581ecd248a","title":"extends","content":"A role can be a specialization (extension) of one or more roles"},"references/eSubpackages/c4/references/eClassifiers/Code/index.html":{"path":"C4/Code","action-uuid":"8c351706-b2e5-4c7b-b88c-4040b6d0183a","title":"Code","content":"TODO&hellip; 1 Copied verbatim from The C4 model for visualizing software architecture under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ↩"},"index.html":{"action-uuid":"e62b20ab-b310-4bbd-8fea-11b99349f749","title":"Architecture Model","content":"This model provides classes for documenting (software) architectures. It is built on top of the Graph model The model can be used AS-IS or as a base for specialized models. C4 sub-package is an example of such a specialized model. Internet Banking System Architecture (sources) is an example of AS-IS use and mapping of a Drawio diagram to this model to generate HTML documentation. The mapping process is explained in the Beyond Diagrams book. The below diagram shows model elements and their relationships. Inherited relationships are not shown. Architecture element is the base class for other model elements. It may have an icon, a name, documentation, and start/end. Start and end may be absolute or relative. Undergoer interface is implemented by classes which can be acted/operated upon by actors in roles. Roles are defined at the undergoer level. Architecture Description extends Architecture Element, Undergoer, and Documented Named Graph. It means that it may contain graph elements, including Architecture Description Elements. It may define actors. Architecture Description Element extends Architecture Element, Undergoer, and Documented Named Graph Element, i.e. it can be an element of Architecture Description (as the name suggests) and other graphs. Relationship extends Architecture Element, Undergoer, and Documented Named Connection. I.e. it may connect sources and targets, including relationship source and relationship target. Tunnel is a specialization of Relationship which can aggregate (group) other relationships. Domain is both Architecture Description and Architecture Description Element. Domains can be used create a hierarchy of architecture descriptions, similar to file system directories. Relationship source is an Architecture Description Element which can be a source of relationships. Relationship target is an Architecture Description Element which can be a target of relationships.

Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim. The diagram uses free icons from Icons8 to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. The diagram was mapped the Architecture model using properties of the diagram elements. Then the architecture model was transformed to the HTML Application model and a static web site was generated from that model. For the majority of elements icons were generated from the diagram images of the respective elements. The web site is deployed by GitHub Pages. Notes: Diagram elements have tooltips with descriptions from the C4 model site. A click on a diagram element navigates to the element page. The left navigation provides a filter to quickly find a model element by name. Search provides full-text search which also searches for text in diagrams. Glossary provides a list of &ldquo;terms&rdquo; - a dictionary of the language of the system. It needs improvements - currently it shows all actions. Uncheck &ldquo;Hide UUID&rdquo; to see the elements. Elements can be filtered using the filter text field. There is a link to the source code on GitHub in the footer. Connections (relationships) are not mapped in this demo. The the above diagram is a System Context diagram, which is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with. Mapping Root -&gt; ArchitectureDescription Surroundings -&gt; Node Internet Banking System -&gt; CompositeNode Root -&gt; ArchitectureDescription The root of the diagram is mapped to Architecture Description with the type property set to ArchitectureDescription This documentation was generated from internet-banking-system-architecture.md markdown file with the image above embedded using png-resource fenced block and the diagram embedded using drawio fenced block with representations/drawio/diagram expansion token. Diagram semantic elements were mapped to the root semantic element (ArchitectureDescription) using the following feature-map: container:\n  self: \n    elements:\n      path: 2\n      comparator: label\n The above mapping means that use the semantic element of this diagram element (root) and add semantic elements of its descendants at path length 2 to the elements reference ordering by label. Path length is set to 2 because the diagram elements are contained by the background layer, which is in turn contained by the root. page-element set to true specifies that the root semantic element shall also be the page&rsquo;s semantic elements. Because this is the top-level page (not linked from diagram elements), it also becomes the document&rsquo;s semantic element and as such the contents element of the diagram&rsquo;s Ecore resource. spec sets archtiecture description name to &ldquo;Internet Banking System Architecture&rdquo; - this is what is displayed in the grey navigation bar above: name: Internet Banking System Architecture\n Surroundings -&gt; Node &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo;, &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mainframe Banking System&rdquo; diagram elements are mapped to Node. They have semantic-id property to demonstrate its usage. Another way to provide meaningful ID&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s is to edit element ID&rsquo;s - this approach is used on lower-level diagrams. The &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; element does not have an image associated with it and therefore uses an explicit icon spec: icon: https://img.icons8.com/officel/16/user.png\n Tooltips are copied from descriptions on the C4 Model diagram. Internet Banking System -&gt; CompositeNode The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; diagram element is mapped to CompositeNode because it has sub-elements. It is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page.
