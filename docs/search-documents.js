This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends (or vice versa). Unfortunately the term &ldquo;software system&rdquo; is the hardest of the C4 model abstractions to define, and this isn&rsquo;t helped by the fact that each organisation will also have their own terminology for describing the same thing, typically using terms such as &ldquo;application&rdquo;, &ldquo;product&rdquo;, &ldquo;service&rdquo;, etc. One way to think about it is that a software system is something a single software development team is building, owns, has responsibility for, and can see the internal implementation details of. Perhaps the code for that software system resides in a single source code repository, and anybody on the team is entitled to modify it. In many cases, the boundary of a software system will correspond to the boundary of a single team. It may also be the case that everything inside the boundary of a software system is deployed at the same time.1 Copied verbatim from The C4 model for visualizing software architecture under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ↩"},"demo/c4/cerulean/references/elements/Q9qKH9tl9N2e6UXnhQ6L-2/index.html":{"action-uuid":"f6381a9a-477c-4721-925a-4a6872294573","title":"Person","content":"TODO TODO"},"references/eClassifiers/Role/references/eStructuralFeatures/extends/index.html":{"path":"Role/References/extends","action-uuid":"54fd8a29-d6aa-414f-8c70-43b4000e6c20","title":"extends","content":"A role can be a specialization (extension) of one or more roles"},"demo/internet-banking-system-c4/cerulean/references/elements/internet-banking-system/index.html":{"action-uuid":"c0f6f381-1f53-4dc3-b3fb-b574f7d0d11a","title":"Internet Banking System","content":"The the above diagram is a Container diagram, which is &ldquo;zoom-in to the system boundary&rdquo;.

It was designed to be compatible with semantic mapping explained here to simplify migration. Basic demo Generated documentation sites with different Bootswatch themes: Cerulean Sketchy Source code Quick Start Start Drawio editor - in-browser, desktop (also drawio.io Diagrams in Microsoft Store), or VS Code extension. Create a new diagram from https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/resources/c4-template.drawio template Add https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/resources/C4.xml library Add elements from the C4 library above to the diagram. You may edit elements id&rsquo;s or add semantic-id property to have meaningful (semantic) URL&rsquo;s in generated documentation and meaningful identifiers for cross-referencing. Create additional diagram pages for diagram elements with internal structures. E.g. a System consisting of Containers. Link the diagram elements to their respective pages. There can be multiple levels of diagram hierarchy. Add Context container from the C4 library to a sub-diargram page. Add children of the diagram element to the context container. E.g. containers to a system context container. Add diagram elements to link already defined elements. E.g. a Person. Remove type property and add selector property to link the diagram element to an already defined mapping of a diagram element to a semantic element. For example, getDocument().getModelElementById('user') would link a diagram element to another diagram element with id user. getDocument().getModelElementByProperty('semantic-id', 'personal-banking-customer') selects an element by its property value. It is also possible to do page-level selections: getDocument().getPageByXXX().getModelElementByXXX(). Save the diagram. Use Nasdanika CLI app/model/site command or app/model/action command and then app/site command to generate documentation site. Linking relationships Relationships documentation can be accessed by clicking relationships on diagrams in generated documentation. To link relationships from Markdown use references/outgoingConnections/&lt;id&gt;/index.html URL relative to the relationship source. &lt;id&gt; stands for the semantic id, which defaults to the diagram element id if not set via semantic-id property.

Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The diagram uses free icons from Icons8 to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. The diagram was mapped to the Architecture model using properties of the diagram elements as explained in the Beyond Diagrams book. Then the architecture model was transformed to the HTML Application model and a static web site was generated from that model. For the majority of elements icons were generated from the diagram images of the respective elements. The web site is deployed by GitHub Pages. Notes: Diagram elements have tooltips with descriptions from the C4 model site. A click on a diagram element navigates to the element page. The left navigation provides a filter to quickly find a model element by name. Search provides full-text search which also searches for text in diagrams. Glossary provides a list of &ldquo;terms&rdquo; - a dictionary of the language of the system. It needs improvements - currently it shows all actions. Uncheck &ldquo;Hide UUID&rdquo; to see the elements. Elements can be filtered using the filter text field. There is a link to the source code on GitHub in the footer. Only Send e-mail using relationship is mapped and documented in this demo. The the above diagram is a System Context diagram, which is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with. Mapping Root -&gt; c4.Context Surroundings -&gt; Person, System Internet Banking System -&gt; System Root -&gt; c4.Context The root of the diagram is mapped to Context with the type property set to c4.Context This documentation was generated from internet-banking-system-architecture.md markdown file with the image above embedded using png-resource fenced block and the diagram embedded using drawio fenced block with representations/drawio/diagram expansion token. Diagram semantic elements were mapped to the root semantic element (c4.Context) using the following feature map: container:\n  self: \n    elements:\n      path: 2\n      comparator: label\n The above mapping means that use the semantic element of this diagram element (root) and add semantic elements of its descendants at path length 2 to the elements reference ordering by label. Path length is set to 2 because the diagram elements are contained by the background layer, which is in turn contained by the root. page-element set to true specifies that the root semantic element shall also be the page&rsquo;s semantic elements. Because this is the top-level page (not linked from diagram elements), it also becomes the document&rsquo;s semantic element and as such the contents element of the diagram&rsquo;s Ecore resource. spec sets archtiecture description name to &ldquo;Internet Banking System Architecture&rdquo; - this is what is displayed in the grey navigation bar above: name: Internet Banking System Architecture\n Surroundings -&gt; Person, System &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; is mapped to Person. &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mainframe Banking System&rdquo; diagram elements are mapped to System. They have semantic-id property to demonstrate its usage. Another way to provide meaningful ID&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s is to edit element ID&rsquo;s - this approach is used on lower-level diagrams. The &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; element does not have an image associated with it and therefore uses an explicit icon spec: icon: https://img.icons8.com/officel/16/user.png\n Tooltips are copied from descriptions on the C4 Model diagram. Internet Banking System -&gt; System The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; diagram element is mapped to System. It is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page. Generation This site was generated with a JUnit test.
