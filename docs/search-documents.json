    "content": "A software system is the highest level of abstraction and describes something that delivers value to its users, whether they are human or not. This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends (or vice versa). Unfortunately the term &ldquo;software system&rdquo; is the hardest of the C4 model abstractions to define, and this isn&rsquo;t helped by the fact that each organisation will also have their own terminology for describing the same thing, typically using terms such as &ldquo;application&rdquo;, &ldquo;product&rdquo;, &ldquo;service&rdquo;, etc. One way to think about it is that a software system is something a single software development team is building, owns, has responsibility for, and can see the internal implementation details of. Perhaps the code for that software system resides in a single source code repository, and anybody on the team is entitled to modify it. In many cases, the boundary of a software system will correspond to the boundary of a single team. It may also be the case that everything inside the boundary of a software system is deployed at the same time.1 Copied verbatim from The C4 model for visualizing software architecture under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. â†©",

It is not really necessary here - the order would not change without it. It is provided as an example because connection conditions may be necessary in some cases for proper ordering in diagrams with connection cycles. Container elements All diagram elements within the system container are mapped to c4.Containers. The API Application is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;API Application Component Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page. The API Application diagram element defines base-uri property as %id%/. Because &ldquo;Placeholders&rdquo; is checked, %id%/ expands to api-application/ during loading. doc-ref is set to readme.md, which in combination with base-uri resolves to api-appliction/readme.md.

    "content": "This site was generated as explained below: A Drawio diagram of an Internet Banking System was created based on images and descriptions from The C4 model for visualising software architecture. Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The diagram uses free icons from Icons8 to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. The diagram was mapped to the Architecture model using properties of the diagram elements as explained in the Beyond Diagrams book. Then the architecture model was transformed to the HTML Application model and a static web site was generated from that model. For the majority of elements icons were generated from the diagram images of the respective elements. The web site is deployed by GitHub Pages. Notes: Diagram elements have tooltips with descriptions from the C4 model site. A click on a diagram element navigates to the element page. The left navigation provides a filter to quickly find a model element by name. Search provides full-text search which also searches for text in diagrams. Glossary provides a list of &ldquo;terms&rdquo; - a dictionary of the language of the system. It needs improvements - currently it shows all actions. Uncheck &ldquo;Hide UUID&rdquo; to see the elements. Elements can be filtered using the filter text field. There is a link to the source code on GitHub in the footer. Connections (relationships) are not mapped in this demo. The the above diagram is a System Context diagram, which is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with. Mapping Root -&gt; ArchitectureDescription Surroundings -&gt; Node Internet Banking System -&gt; CompositeNode Root -&gt; ArchitectureDescription The root of the diagram is mapped to Architecture Description with the type property set to ArchitectureDescription This documentation was generated from internet-banking-system-architecture.md markdown file with the image above embedded using png-resource fenced block and the diagram embedded using drawio fenced block with representations/drawio/diagram expansion token. Diagram semantic elements were mapped to the root semantic element (ArchitectureDescription) using the following feature-map: container:\n  self: \n    elements:\n      path: 2\n      comparator: label\n The above mapping means that use the semantic element of this diagram element (root) and add semantic elements of its descendants at path length 2 to the elements reference ordering by label. Path length is set to 2 because the diagram elements are contained by the background layer, which is in turn contained by the root. page-element set to true specifies that the root semantic element shall also be the page&rsquo;s semantic elements. Because this is the top-level page (not linked from diagram elements), it also becomes the document&rsquo;s semantic element and as such the contents element of the diagram&rsquo;s Ecore resource. spec sets archtiecture description name to &ldquo;Internet Banking System Architecture&rdquo; - this is what is displayed in the grey navigation bar above: name: Internet Banking System Architecture\n Surroundings -&gt; Node &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo;, &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mainframe Banking System&rdquo; diagram elements are mapped to Node. They have semantic-id property to demonstrate its usage. Another way to provide meaningful ID&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s is to edit element ID&rsquo;s - this approach is used on lower-level diagrams. The &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; element does not have an image associated with it and therefore uses an explicit icon spec: icon: https://img.icons8.com/officel/16/user.png\n Tooltips are copied from descriptions on the C4 Model diagram. Internet Banking System -&gt; CompositeNode The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; diagram element is mapped to CompositeNode because it has sub-elements. It is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page. Generation This site was generated with a JUnit test. Another way to generate documentation site is to use Nasdanika CLI app/model/site command or app/model/action command and then app/site command.

    "content": "This site was generated as explained below: A Drawio diagram of an Internet Banking System was created based on images and descriptions from The C4 model for visualising software architecture. Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The diagram uses free icons from Icons8 to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. The diagram was mapped to the Architecture model using properties of the diagram elements as explained in the Beyond Diagrams book. Then the architecture model was transformed to the HTML Application model and a static web site was generated from that model. For the majority of elements icons were generated from the diagram images of the respective elements. The web site is deployed by GitHub Pages. Notes: Diagram elements have tooltips with descriptions from the C4 model site. A click on a diagram element navigates to the element page. The left navigation provides a filter to quickly find a model element by name. Search provides full-text search which also searches for text in diagrams. Glossary provides a list of &ldquo;terms&rdquo; - a dictionary of the language of the system. It needs improvements - currently it shows all actions. Uncheck &ldquo;Hide UUID&rdquo; to see the elements. Elements can be filtered using the filter text field. There is a link to the source code on GitHub in the footer. Only Send e-mail using relationship is mapped and documented in this demo. The the above diagram is a System Context diagram, which is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with. Mapping Root -&gt; c4.Context Surroundings -&gt; Person, System Internet Banking System -&gt; System Root -&gt; c4.Context The root of the diagram is mapped to Context with the type property set to c4.Context This documentation was generated from internet-banking-system-architecture.md markdown file with the image above embedded using png-resource fenced block and the diagram embedded using drawio fenced block with representations/drawio/diagram expansion token. Diagram semantic elements were mapped to the root semantic element (c4.Context) using the following feature map: container:\n  self: \n    elements:\n      path: 2\n      comparator: label\n The above mapping means that use the semantic element of this diagram element (root) and add semantic elements of its descendants at path length 2 to the elements reference ordering by label. Path length is set to 2 because the diagram elements are contained by the background layer, which is in turn contained by the root. page-element set to true specifies that the root semantic element shall also be the page&rsquo;s semantic elements. Because this is the top-level page (not linked from diagram elements), it also becomes the document&rsquo;s semantic element and as such the contents element of the diagram&rsquo;s Ecore resource. spec sets archtiecture description name to &ldquo;Internet Banking System Architecture&rdquo; - this is what is displayed in the grey navigation bar above: name: Internet Banking System Architecture\n Surroundings -&gt; Person, System &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; is mapped to Person. &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mainframe Banking System&rdquo; diagram elements are mapped to System. They have semantic-id property to demonstrate its usage. Another way to provide meaningful ID&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s is to edit element ID&rsquo;s - this approach is used on lower-level diagrams. The &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; element does not have an image associated with it and therefore uses an explicit icon spec: icon: https://img.icons8.com/officel/16/user.png\n Tooltips are copied from descriptions on the C4 Model diagram. Internet Banking System -&gt; System The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; diagram element is mapped to System. It is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page. Generation This site was generated with a JUnit test. Another way to generate documentation site is to use Nasdanika CLI app/model/site command or app/model/action command and then app/site command.

    "content": "This model provides classes for documenting (software) architectures. It is built on top of the Graph model The model can be used AS-IS or as a base for specialized models. C4 sub-package is an example of such a specialized model. Internet Banking System Architecture (sources) is an example of AS-IS use and mapping of a Drawio diagram to this model to generate HTML documentation. The mapping process is explained in the Beyond Diagrams book. The below diagram shows model elements and their relationships. Inherited relationships are not shown. Architecture element is the base class for other model elements. It may have an icon, a name, documentation, and start/end. Start and end may be absolute or relative. Undergoer interface is implemented by classes which can be acted/operated upon by actors in roles. Roles are defined at the undergoer level. Architecture Description extends Architecture Element, Undergoer, and Documented Named Graph. It means that it may contain graph elements, including Architecture Description Elements. It may define actors. Architecture Description Element extends Architecture Element, Undergoer, and Documented Named Graph Element, i.e. it can be an element of Architecture Description (as the name suggests) and other graphs. Relationship extends Architecture Element, Undergoer, and Documented Named Connection. I.e. it may connect sources and targets, including relationship source and relationship target. Tunnel is a specialization of Relationship which can aggregate (group) other relationships. Domain is both Architecture Description and Architecture Description Element. Domains can be used create a hierarchy of architecture descriptions, similar to file system directories. Relationship source is an Architecture Description Element which can be a source of relationships. Relationship target is an Architecture Description Element which can be a target of relationships. Node is both relationship source and target. Relationship source, target and Node have Composite flavors which are also domains, i.e. may contain Architecture Description Elements.

    "content": "Classes in this package are mappings of the architecture model classes to the abstractions of the The C4 model for visualising software architecture. The classes in this package do not introduce any new structural features (attributes or references) or operations, just new semantics. E.g. System and Container extend CompositeNode - they can have documentation, icon, incoming and outgoing connections, nested elements, &hellip; The difference between them is in definitions. Demos Internet Banking System Generated documentation sites with different Bootswatch themes: Cerulean - can be used to publish the base line architecture - what is already deployed. Sketchy - can be used to publish future architectures. Source code Direct Generation There is also a demo of documentation produced with &ldquo;Direct Generation&rdquo; approach explained in Visual communication continuum story (also in Resources): Site Sources The direct generation approach is simpler and might be easier to get started with. It was designed to be compatible with semantic mapping explained here to simplify migration. Basic demo Generated documentation sites with different Bootswatch themes: Cerulean Sketchy Source code Quick Start Start Drawio editor - in-browser, desktop (also drawio.io Diagrams in Microsoft Store), or VS Code extension. Create a new diagram from https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/resources/c4-template.drawio template Add https://architecture.models.nasdanika.org/resources/C4.xml library Add elements from the C4 library above to the diagram. You may edit elements id&rsquo;s or add semantic-id property to have meaningful (semantic) URL&rsquo;s in generated documentation and meaningful identifiers for cross-referencing. Create additional diagram pages for diagram elements with internal structures. E.g. a System consisting of Containers. Link the diagram elements to their respective pages. There can be multiple levels of diagram hierarchy. Add Context container from the C4 library to a sub-diargram page. Add children of the diagram element to the context container. E.g. containers to a system context container. Add diagram elements to link already defined elements. E.g. a Person. Remove type property and add selector property to link the diagram element to an already defined mapping of a diagram element to a semantic element. For example, getDocument().getModelElementById('user') would link a diagram element to another diagram element with id user. getDocument().getModelElementByProperty('semantic-id', 'personal-banking-customer') selects an element by its property value. It is also possible to do page-level selections: getDocument().getPageByXXX().getModelElementByXXX(). Save the diagram. Use Nasdanika CLI app/model/site command or app/model/action command and then app/site command to generate documentation site. Linking relationships Relationships documentation can be accessed by clicking relationships on diagrams in generated documentation. To link relationships from Markdown use references/outgoingConnections/&lt;id&gt;/index.html URL relative to the relationship source. &lt;id&gt; stands for the semantic id, which defaults to the diagram element id if not set via semantic-id property. Sample command nsd app model site -f C:\\_temp\\c4\\c4.drawio C:\\_temp\\c4\\site --root-action-text=&quot;Nasdanika C4 Model Demos&quot;\n Resources Visual communication continuum story introduces &ldquo;Direct Generation&rdquo; of documentation from diagrams, which is simpler than semantic mapping. I also compares direct generation with semantic mapping. Architecture As Code story explains high level concepts and possible applications of the architecture model. Beyond Diagrams book provides a detailed explanation how to map Drawio diagrams to semantic models, make them executable, &hellip; The book is still work in progress, more installments to come!

    "content": "This site was generated as explained below: A Drawio diagram of an Internet Banking System was created based on images and descriptions from The C4 model for visualising software architecture. Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The diagram uses free icons from Icons8 to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. The diagram was mapped to the Architecture model using properties of the diagram elements as explained in the Beyond Diagrams book. Then the architecture model was transformed to the HTML Application model and a static web site was generated from that model. For the majority of elements icons were generated from the diagram images of the respective elements. The web site is deployed by GitHub Pages. Notes: Diagram elements have tooltips with descriptions from the C4 model site. A click on a diagram element navigates to the element page. The left navigation provides a filter to quickly find a model element by name. Search provides full-text search which also searches for text in diagrams. Glossary provides a list of &ldquo;terms&rdquo; - a dictionary of the language of the system. It needs improvements - currently it shows all actions. Uncheck &ldquo;Hide UUID&rdquo; to see the elements. Elements can be filtered using the filter text field. There is a link to the source code on GitHub in the footer. Only Send e-mail using relationship is mapped and documented in this demo. The the above diagram is a System Context diagram, which is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with. Mapping Root -&gt; c4.Context Surroundings -&gt; Person, System Internet Banking System -&gt; System Root -&gt; c4.Context The root of the diagram is mapped to Context with the type property set to c4.Context This documentation was generated from internet-banking-system-architecture.md markdown file with the image above embedded using png-resource fenced block and the diagram embedded using drawio fenced block with representations/drawio/diagram expansion token. Diagram semantic elements were mapped to the root semantic element (c4.Context) using the following feature map: container:\n  self: \n    elements:\n      path: 2\n      comparator: label\n The above mapping means that use the semantic element of this diagram element (root) and add semantic elements of its descendants at path length 2 to the elements reference ordering by label. Path length is set to 2 because the diagram elements are contained by the background layer, which is in turn contained by the root. page-element set to true specifies that the root semantic element shall also be the page&rsquo;s semantic elements. Because this is the top-level page (not linked from diagram elements), it also becomes the document&rsquo;s semantic element and as such the contents element of the diagram&rsquo;s Ecore resource. spec sets archtiecture description name to &ldquo;Internet Banking System Architecture&rdquo; - this is what is displayed in the grey navigation bar above: name: Internet Banking System Architecture\n Surroundings -&gt; Person, System &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; is mapped to Person. &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mainframe Banking System&rdquo; diagram elements are mapped to System. They have semantic-id property to demonstrate its usage. Another way to provide meaningful ID&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s is to edit element ID&rsquo;s - this approach is used on lower-level diagrams. The &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo; element does not have an image associated with it and therefore uses an explicit icon spec: icon: https://img.icons8.com/officel/16/user.png\n Tooltips are copied from descriptions on the C4 Model diagram. Internet Banking System -&gt; System The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; diagram element is mapped to System. It is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page. Generation This site was generated with a JUnit test. Another way to generate documentation site is to use Nasdanika CLI app/model/site command or app/model/action command and then app/site command.

    "content": "The the above diagram is a Container diagram, which is &ldquo;zoom-in to the system boundary&rdquo;. Mapping Surroundings -&gt; selectors &ldquo;Personal Banking Customer&rdquo;, &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mainframe Banking System&rdquo; diagram elements are mapped to the same semantic elements as on the System Context Diagram using selectors. The system context diagram defines the surrounding nodes and this diagram references them. This is a selector of the &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo;: getDocument().getModelElementByProperty('semantic-id', 'microsoft-exchange')\n The loading logic &ldquo;carries over&rdquo; tooltips from the System Context Diagram to this diagram. Internet Banking System The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; container maps to the same semantic element as on the System Context diagram because: The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; element on the System Context Diagram links to this diagram page. The &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; element on this diagram has page-element property set to true. Semantic elements of the child elements of the &ldquo;Internet Banking System&rdquo; element are mapped to the elements reference and ordered with the flow comparator: container:\n  self: \n    elements:\n      path: 1\n      comparator: \n        flow: \n          fallback: label\n          condition: id != 'send-email'\n The condition prevents traversal of the &ldquo;API Application&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;E-mail System&rdquo; connection. It is not really necessary here - the order would not change without it. It is provided as an example because connection conditions may be necessary in some cases for proper ordering in diagrams with connection cycles. Containers All containers within the system except the &ldquo;API Application&rdquo; are mapped to Nodes, similar to the surroundings on the System Context diagram. API Application The &ldquo;API Application&rdquo; diagram element is mapped to CompositeNode because it has sub-elements. It is linked to the &ldquo;Container Diagram&rdquo; page. As such, its semantic element is mapped to the &ldquo;API Application Component Diagram&rdquo; page element as well allowing further mapping on that page. This diagram element defines base-uri property as %id%/. Because &ldquo;Placeholders&rdquo; is checked, %id%/ expands to api-application/ during loading. doc-ref is set to readme.md, which in combination with base-uri resolves to api-appliction/readme.md.
